# My First GitHub Repository

> *Learning how to document projects using Markdown and GitHub.*

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository was created as a **practice project** to explore how GitHub works and how a well-written `README.md` helps explain a project to others. The focus is not on complex programming, but on **clear documentation**, **organization**, and **version control**.

Through this project, I learned how to:
- Create and manage a GitHub repository  
- Edit files directly in GitHub  
- Use Markdown for formatting  
- Commit changes properly

## Tools & Technologies

The tools below were used or referenced during this project:

- **GitHub** – repository hosting and version control  
- **Markdown** – formatting documentation

## 📂 Files Included

Below is an example of the files that may be included in this repository:

- `README.md` → Project documentation  
- `pgmname1.R` → Sample program file  
- `filename1.csv` → Example dataset  
- `examples.html` → Basic HTML file  

## How to Run Program

To run this project, make sure all files are present in the folder. Open the program file with the software it was written for:

- '.R files' → RStudio
- '.py files' → Python
- '.html files' → a web browser

## Additional Information

This project is mainly for learning purposes and documentation practice. I could expand it by:

- Adding real data files
- Improving program functionality
- Including screenshots or examples in the README

### Folder structure (for reference):

```text
Hello_World/
│── README.md
│── pgmname1.R
│── filename1.csv
│── examples.html
This layout ensures that the program can access all files it needs.
